### To fixed

The main problem I had, was the reload of the page. It does not work yet and after every action on the page we do refresh it manually.

### To be continued

- Search bar (filter products, sort products)
- Update informations of a product (title, picture, price)

### Stacks

- JavaScript, React.js
- HTML5, CSS3
